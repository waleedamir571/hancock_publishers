				</div>
				<p>
				The following terms and conditions apply to projects undertaken by 
					<a class="term-privacy" href="https://hancockpublishers.com/">www.hancockpublishers.com</a>:
				</p>
				<h3>COPYRIGHT</h3>
				<p>You own the copyright to any content we develop for you and will deliver it according to the terms we have agreed upon. We will not have any copyright over your content, and therefore, you will be free to use and publish it however you wish.</p>
				<h3>PAYMENT</h3>
				<p>To purchase all the services listed on our site, full payment is required. However, we also offer the option to get started with a 50% upfront payment. The customer is responsible for all transaction costs, including any applicable tax charges.</p>
				<h3>REVISIONS</h3>
				<p>We will allow unlimited revisions to the work delivered as long as you request them within 14 days of delivery. Revision requests are processed based on the urgency of the work and will have a minimum deadline of 24 hours. We will provide unlimited revisions after the final draft is received and approved by the customer.</p>
				<p>Revisions can be requested after the ordering process, once the product has been submitted for review and its status has changed to "Waiting for Customer Approval." At this point, the customer can request revisions by emailing their designated Project Manager to verify that the original requirements are met for the entire product.</p>
				<p>In addition, customers are allowed to make any changes at their discretion to any material we send them after the order is completed and before publishing, given that the content is provided in Word format. They have the right to the content. Our customers can control the final product and make any changes in line with their goals and preferences.</p>
				<h3>CHANGE OF MIND</h3>
				<p>At Hancock Publishers, we understand that clients may sometimes change their minds about their work. In these instances, it is important to note that we do not offer refunds. We believe in maintaining the integrity of our refund policy and urge customers to consider their plans carefully before proceeding.</p>
				<h3>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</h3>
				<p>All project requirements are discussed with the client before the start of the project. The resolution of disputes at the service level will adhere to the terms and conditions agreed upon at the beginning of the project, including these terms and conditions and acceptable business practices.</p>
				<h3>REFUND POLICY</h3>
				<p>Hancock Publishers offers a 100% refund on all our services at any stage of the project should a customer feel that their needs are not fully met. However, this is not an unconditional refund, and certain terms and conditions apply.</p>
				<p>
				The refund policy of Hancock Publishers is null and void in the following circumstances:
				<ul>
					<li>
					You have demanded changes beyond the original ideas.
					</li>
					<li>
					If an order is put on hold at the customer's request, the refund will be canceled.
					</li>
					<li>
					The company’s policies have been violated.
					</li>
					<li>
					The client has not provided all the necessary information to create the brief.
					</li>
					<li>
					Reasons such as 'change of mind,' 'disagreement with a partner,' or other reasons not related to the service provided are not eligible for a refund.
					</li>
					<li>
					After a customer has approved multiple rounds of adjustments (for any service), refunds cannot be made.
					</li>
				</ul>
